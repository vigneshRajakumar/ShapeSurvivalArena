# ShapeSurvivalArena
SSA is a multiplayer, round-based dual-stick shooter game multiplayer shooter viewed from top-down. Players control a ship that looks like basic geometry (triangles, circles, etc.) and compete with each other to see who survives last.

Before each round, players choose one of X different shapes and each shape has different attributes (e.g. triangles can move faster, circles can shoot further, etc.). Players are then given Y number of lives per round and can shoot each other while avoiding pitfalls and traps randomly placed by the server.
